                Dining Philosophers
Model a dining philosophers problem with four philosophers. There must be exactly eight
processes, one for each philosopher and each fork. There must also be a Boolean array \
eating
"
of size four, whose elements will indicate whether a philosopher is eating or not. In other words,
\
eating[i]
" is true i the
i
-th philosopher is eating.
You are free to introduce additional variables and channels (but not processes). Avoid unnec-
essary complexity.
Verify the following properties:
no deadlock
dp1.ltl
: no livelock
dp2.ltl
: no starvation
dp3.ltl
: it is never possible for two adjacent philosophers to be eating at the same time.
